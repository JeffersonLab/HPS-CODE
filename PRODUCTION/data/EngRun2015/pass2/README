**********************************************************************
5623 is 1st run with SVT @ 0.5mm.  You may want to submit 0.5 mm first.
**********************************************************************


**********************************************************************
All xml files for 0.5 and 1.5 mm are setup and ready to go in ./jsubs.

They are expecting there to be a (currently nonexisting) jar file here
for the new release:

/u/group/hps_soft/hps-java/hps-distribution-3.4.0-bin.jar

and are setup to use the release tag "R340" in the output file names
and the output directories on disk and tape named "pass2".

All DSTs are setup to goto disk, as are all both moller and pulser LCIO
skims (see below).  Unskimmed LCIOs are only going to disk for the
"canonical" runs (5772,5739,5698) and calibration runs.  Calibration
runs are unblinded, everything else is blinded (every 10th file only).
**********************************************************************




**********************************************************************
Run all scripts with current working directory:
/u/group/hps/production/data/EngRun2015/pass2
**********************************************************************




**********************************************************************
This will submit all xml files between R1 and R2, and move those
xml files to jsub-subbed:

`./scripts/jsub.sh R1 R2`
`./scripts/jsub.sh 5623 5800`  (0.5 mm only)
**********************************************************************



**********************************************************************
If you need to remake the xml files:

  If necessary, edit ./templates/all.xml (e.g. remove the moller skim)
  Move or remove the ./jsub directory
  Run `./allruns.py` 

allruns.py can take various arguments to customize the xml files without
changing the template.  The ones you might want:

`./allruns.py JAR=/path/to/release.jar RELEASE=R341 PASS=pass2.1`
*********************************************************************



**********************************************************************
You may want to keep tabs on the total pass2 usage on disk:
`du -sh /work/hallb/hps/data/engrun2015/pass2`

And hps's quota on /work:
https://scicomp.jlab.org/scicomp/#/disk/work

Although I don't expect it to be an issue, possible trimmings include
gzipping all the txt files, deleting skims.
