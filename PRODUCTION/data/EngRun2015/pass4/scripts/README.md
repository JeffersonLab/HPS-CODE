``mkjsubs.py`` generates the submission scripts in ``./jsubs``

``jsub.sh`` submits them and moves them to ``./jsubs-subbed``

``generateLists.sh`` is used to generate file lists

In all cases ```pwd``` should be at the same level as this ``scripts`` directory.

Everything else is for cleanup/diagnostics/testing.
