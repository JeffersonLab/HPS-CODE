``mkjsubs.py`` generates the submission scripts in ``./jsubs``

``jsub.sh`` submits them and moves them to ``./jsubs-subbed``

``generateLists.sh`` is used to generate file lists

In all cases ``pwd`` should be at the same level as this ``scripts`` directory.

---

All other scripts are for cleanup/diagnostics/testing.

TODO: Remove dependence on ``generateLists.sh`` by ``mkjsubs.py``

TODO: Remove hardcoding of top level dir for next run (i.e. EngRun2015)
